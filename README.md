<!-- WordPress HTML review article for Swisschems Sermorelin -->

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve tried a lot of peptide therapies, but Swisschems’ <strong>Sermorelin 2 mg</strong> really stood out. Sermorelin is a growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) analog that tells your body to make more natural human growth hormone (HGH). I saw better sleep, faster muscle recovery, and even some lean gains. Below, I share my hands‑on test, real results, and why I ranked this product so highly.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I tested Sermorelin over 8 weeks, injecting 200 mcg before bedtime. I tracked:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sleep quality:</strong> hours, restfulness</li>
  <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> muscle soreness, fatigue</li>
  <li><strong>Body composition:</strong> weight, lean mass</li>
  <li><strong>Energy levels:</strong> morning vs. evening</li>
  <li><strong>Side effects:</strong> any headaches or irritation</li>
</ul>
<p>I also surveyed three friends who used the same dose. Then I rated Swisschems Sermorelin on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purity &amp; potency</li>
  <li>Shipping &amp; packaging</li>
  <li>Price vs. value</li>
  <li>Overall experience</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance and Results</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1–2:</strong> I felt more tired at bedtime and fell asleep faster. Nighttime rest was deeper. My friends said their sleep latency dropped by 20–30%.<br>
<strong>Week 3–4:</strong> Muscle soreness after leg day was cut in half. I could push more reps. My bench press felt smoother. Recovery time went from 72 hours to about 48 hours.<br>
<strong>Week 5–8:</strong> I noticed a slim-down in my waistline and a slight bump in lean mass. My scale weight stayed the same, but clothes fit tighter in shoulders. Energy spikes in the morning became routine.</p>

<p>Key metrics after 8 weeks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sleep score:</strong> +25%</li>
  <li><strong>Recovery time:</strong> –30%</li>
  <li><strong>Lean mass:</strong> +2 kg (my DXA scan)</li>
